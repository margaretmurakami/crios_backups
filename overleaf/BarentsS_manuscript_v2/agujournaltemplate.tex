% history of amplification
The Arctic has undergone unprecedented changes in recent decades, with air temperatures rising more rapidly than anywhere else on Earth \cite{Cosimo2014,Carmack2015}. This accelerated warming has led to significant declines in sea ice extent and thickness \cite{Perovich2009,Onarheim2018,Stroeve2018}, with the most pronounced changes in the Barents Sea \cite{Onarheim2017}. The increase in surface air temperature (SAT), a phenomenon known as Arctic Amplification \cite{Manabe1980}, is correlated these reductions in sea ice and a notable warming signal in the upper ocean \cite{Serreze2009,Screen2010,Pithan2014,Marshall2014}. These changes can alter mixed layer nutrient content, with implications for marine ecosystems and fishing economies \cite{Fossheim2015,Polyakov2020_borealization}. Moreover, Arctic warming may impact midlatitude weather \cite{Honda2009}. Several positive feedback mechanisms, including lapse rate, surface albedo reduction, and increased atmospheric water vapor, are thought to reinforce observed warming \cite{Pithan2014,Timmermans2018,Pistone2019,Previdi2021}. However, Arctic Amplification is nonuniform and intensified in the Northern Barents Sea \cite{Previdi2021,Rantanen2022}, yet some models still fail to reproduce observations \cite{Huang2017}. In light of these changes, a deeper understanding of the drivers of ocean heat content variability is urgently needed.

% papers on the barents sea hydrography:
The Barents Sea is both a key region for Arctic Amplification and a receiver of increased heat flux from the Atlantic through the Barents Sea Opening \cite{Lind2018,Wang2020}.

Atlantic Water (AW) is the primary heat source for the Arctic Ocean, and is advected along the Arctic Boundary Current at depth below a colder, fresher surface layer. In the Barents Sea, marginal to the Arctic, 

The Barents Sea is marginal to the Arctic, acting as a hydrographic transition zone between the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. In the North, the regime of the sea is more similar to the Arctic, with a three-layer structure and seasonal sea ice cover \cite{Loeng1991,Rudels2022}

Atlantic heat can propagate into the Barents Sea \cite{Hakkinen2009}

% borealizatio/ecosystem impacts:
Because the longer open water season has meant increases to NPP, competition for prey in the Barents Sea has shifted affecting both the food sources for marine mammals and the local fishing economies \cite{Bogstad2015,Dalpadado2014}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Original paragraph on the Barents Sea:
% Barents Sea state of the art
    Ocean heat transport and heat loss to the atmosphere in the Nordic Seas have increased substantially over the last century due to the inflow of AW, making the Barents Sea a key warming hotspot for AW heat loss \cite{Smedsrud2022}. The Barents Sea is experiencing rapid changes to its heat and salt content \cite{Cosimo2014}, and recent studies of this region have noted changes both at the gate to the Atlantic Ocean and the gate to the Arctic. The BSO contributes most to ocean heat transport increases in recent years as compared with other gates to the Arctic \cite{Oldenburg2024}, and this heat transport from the Atlantic has been increasing in recent years \cite{Barton18,Wang2019}. At the opening to the Arctic, the winter import of sea ice has been in decline \cite{Lind2018,Lundesgaard2022}. Within the sea itself, recent studies have suggested that the Barents Sea is warming and freshening in recent years \cite{Skagseth2020}, with increases in downward heat transfer \cite{Lind2018}. Persistent sea ice loss over the last century has also meant a thinner CHL and weaker stratification \cite{Onarheim2017,Gerland2023}. There is evidence to suggest a positive feedback loop between the retreat of sea ice and subsequent decline in surface freshwater content, and the increase in heat content of the sea \cite{Arthun2012,Lind2018,Isaksen2022}. This is because with a weaker stratification, vertical mixing which heats the surface from AW below increases \cite{Lundesgaard2022}. Exposure of the ocean surface due to sea ice loss has played a small compensatory role to this heating below, but not greater than the heating impact \cite{Oldenburg2024}. Beyond the potential impact on the climate, studies highlight the borealization \cite{Lind2018,Isaksen2022} and eutrophication \cite{Downes2021} of this region with implications for local fisheries. Still, uncertainties remain surrounding the feedback mechanisms of how sea ice loss and temperature increases reinforce each other, as well as how the exact interactions between the AW inflow and changing sea ice extent. Furthermore, the long-term implications of the changing Barents Sea on the internal Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) remain unclear.

% why is our budget analysis unique

% what is budget analysis

% INCLUDE the equations for this

% FIGURE 3: demonstrate budget analysis in T--S space

\subsection{Temperature--Salinity Analysis}

% FIGURE 4: for the 5 years; motivate this with figure 1 (SI extent timeseries)
% goal of this is to show that the advective term is changing over time as a contribution to heating and salting

\section{Results}

% FIGURE 5: highlight the convergence anomalies for the five years; compare this to figure 2 with the vertical stratification (redistribution away from the center to make a more average looking profile)
% focus on the one month (march) or maybe take a winter average motivated by the literature, use this for 2012 and 2014 to show that less sea ice -- less stratification -- redistribution of water away from the mixing line
