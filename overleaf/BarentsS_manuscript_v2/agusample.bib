abstract = {Earlier results have shown that stronger southwesterly winds give higher temperatures, stronger velocities and higher transports in the North Cape Current (NCaC) in the western Barents Sea. This investigation shows that the wind field causing the stronger southwesterlies also causes a wider NCaC, i.e., the NCaC becomes warmer and wider at the same time. In warm periods, the NCaC seems to be a two-core current system, while it has only one wider core in cold periods. The reason for the fluctuations in the width of the NCaC is a non-uniform wind field across the current. The varying width of the NCaC affects the location of the Polar Front south of Bear Island. The location of this front is not as stationary as earlier believed and in warm periods with strong wind, the front is located further upslope than in cold periods.},

Considering this conversion as a function of sea-surface temperature and salinity leads to the definition of a conversion vector, which represents mass sources and sinks for each water type. The vector representation shows graphically the way the shape of the temperature-salinity relation is driven at the surface by the air-sea heat and fresh water fluxes.},

abstract = {Abstract A theoretical framework for the description of the thermal state and circulation in the ocean is presented. Relations between differential heating, diffusive heat flux and surface drift are derived and discussed in the light of the basic mechanical property of the system, i.e. the tendency for light water to spread on top of heavier water. We find that for low and medium temperatures, the poleward surface drift can be determined directly from a knowledge of the heat flux through the sea surface. Preliminary quantitative estimates indicate that the “Hadley circulation” for the entire ocean involves a volume flux of order 70 ± 30 Sverdrup. For the North Atlantic we find a poleward drift of order 10 Sverdrup which compares well with previous estimates of the southward deep flow. Mean values for the diffusive flux in the ocean are found to be of order 20 W m−2 at 15 °C and 60 W m−2 at 25 °C.},
