    "Goals:\n",
    "- start by checking that the gateways in bravingthebarentsSeaMterm_10_16.ipynb are at least realistic with the convergence of the other J terms\n",
    "- load the G terms and J terms for 2007 as we have saved previously\n",
    "- plot these\n",
    "- calculate the G and J terms as An has described with binwidthT1 and binwidthS1\n",
    "- see if we can plot these similarly.\n",
    "- prove that heat transport as shown by the gates is the same as heat transport through the gates themselves.\n",

    "- compare the change in volume to the overall change J terms\n",
    "- compare the volume transport as represented by the gates to the volume transport in TS space?"
